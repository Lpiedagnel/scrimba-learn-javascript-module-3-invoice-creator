# Invoice Creator – Final Solo Project of the Module 3 of the Scrimba Tutorial “Learn Javascript”

## Goal

This application idea is based on the Module 3 "Final Solo Project" of the Scrimba Tutorial "Learn Javascript": https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript/module-3-final-solo-project-invoice-creator-cVbPpRhD

Warning: this is not an official correction made by Scrimba. If anything, I strongly recommended to try to build this application by yourself before checking this repository!


## Requirements of Scrimba

- Array to hold services requested
- Buttons to add service to an array
- Place to display data from an array - updated every time the array changes
- Don't charge > once for the same service
- Total cost stays updated
- Button to "send invoice" (reset)
- Stretch: remove items after adding
